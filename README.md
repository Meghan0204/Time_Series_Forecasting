# Time Series Forecasting Project

A Time Series Forecasting project completed as part of the **Pandas for Time Series Data Analysis** certification coursework on Udemy. This project demonstrates the use of Python libraries to analyze, visualize, and forecast time-based data.

---

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing time series data and generating forecasts using statistical methods. The main objectives are:  
- Explore and visualize time series data  
- Apply statistical models to identify trends and seasonality  
- Generate forecasts to predict future data points  

---

## Technologies Used
- **statsmodels** – statistical modeling, hypothesis testing, and data exploration  
- **numpy** – numerical computing, arrays, and mathematical operations  
- **pandas** – data manipulation and analysis with DataFrames and Series  
- **matplotlib** – data visualization and plotting  

---

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**  
   - Loaded dataset using pandas  
   - Handled missing values and ensured proper datetime formats  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized trends, seasonality, and anomalies using matplotlib  
   - Generated descriptive statistics to understand data patterns  

3. **Modeling & Forecasting**  
   - Applied statistical models with statsmodels (e.g., ARIMA, seasonal decomposition)  
   - Evaluated model performance using relevant metrics  

4. **Results & Insights**  
   - Plotted forecasts alongside actual data  
   - Highlighted trends, seasonal patterns, and potential actionable insights
